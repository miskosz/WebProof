When presenting math to others it usually comes to LaTeX and typesetting everything into a black-and-white pdf. Why not to make use of modern stuff like **color** and **interactivity**? This is an attempt to make math on the web easier to read than ordinary pdf. And more beautiful.

If you are a designer that can do better than me and wants to contribute, please contact me :)
